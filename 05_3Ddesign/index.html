            <h3>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing</h3>
            <p>This week was all about hands-on experience with 3D design and printing, using Fusion to model objects and a 3D printer to bring those designs to life. Alongside learning the process of 3D printing, I experimented with object scanning through photogrammetry...</p>

            <h4>Part 1: 3D Printing Mjölnir</h4>
            <p>My goal this week was to create something meaningful for my little sister. My siblings and I are huge Marvel fans, and her favorite character is Thor, so I set out to design and 3D print Mjölnir...</p>

            <p>To begin the design process, I used Fusion and followed an online tutorial to develop a basic hammer shape...</p>

            <p>Once satisfied with the design, I exported it into PrusaSlicer, a tool that prepares 3D models for printing...</p>

            <p>The final product turned out great, although it was smaller than I initially imagined...</p>

            <h5>Part 2: 3D Scanning</h5>
            <p>This Tuesday, October 8, one of my favorite soccer players of all time, Andrés Iniesta, retired. To honor his career, I decided to scan the toy figure I have of him using photogrammetry...</p>

            <p>For the photogrammetry process, I started by placing the Iniesta toy on a well-lit, flat surface...</p>

            <p>This is what the scan looked like after I made those cuts:</p>

            <p>The final product came out better and more detailed than I expected...</p>
