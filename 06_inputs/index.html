            <h2>Week 6: Electronic Inputs</h2>

            <h3>Assignment 1: Capactive Sensor</h3>

            <p>This week, we were tasked with making a capacitive sensor to measure a physical quantity with a microcontroller. I thought it’d be cool to integrate my capacitive sensor with a piezo buzzer so that when the coils touched, it would play audio (e.g. a beep).</p>

            <p>To create the capacitive sensor, I relied on the instructions in the PS 70 webpage, and learned that I had to connect one of the coils to pin A3 and the other to digital pin 4 on the microcontroller. To integrate the buzzer in, I relied on wiring directions from this <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Morse-Code-with-Capacitive-Touch/" target="_blank">instructable</a>). In the end, my circuit looked like this:</p>

            <img src="IMG_0048.jpg" alt="stuck display" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

            <p>After uploading my first attempt at code, I realized that when I touched the coils, no audio was outputting. To troubleshoot, I figured out I should debug the audio and the capacitive sensor separately. I ran this code to debug the audio:</p>

            <iframe src="https://app.arduino.cc/sketches/89fc104e-5d13-4276-beec-63cb1007a979?view-mode=embed" style="height:510px;width:100%;margin:10px 0" frameborder=0></iframe>

            <p>The audio was playing. Great! That was not the problem.</p>

            <p>Then I uploaded this code to debug the capacitive sensor. The readings were all 0. Something was wrong.</p>

            <iframe src="https://app.arduino.cc/sketches/22f5a825-1923-40a2-ac3a-d36816635b4b?view-mode=embed" style="height:510px;width:100%;margin:10px 0" frameborder=0></iframe>

            <p>I removed the resistor and uploaded this new integrated code:</p>

            <iframe src="https://app.arduino.cc/sketches/96756ee3-6ad2-4f0b-b692-5f156068b59c?view-mode=embed" style="height:510px;width:100%;margin:10px 0" frameborder=0></iframe>

            <p>It worked!</p>

            <p>Here is a video:</p>

            <video controls>
                <source src="./IMG_0037.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>

            <p>I then updated the code to change the frequency the longer the coils were pressed:</p>

            <video controls>
                <source src="./IMG_0041.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>

            <p>Finally, I modified the code, setting different thresholds based off of the serial value monitors, so that the audio played a certain frequency when the coils were in closer proximity to each other and a different frequency when they touched:</p>

            <video controls>
                <source src="./IMG_0044.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>

            <p>Next, I moved on to thinking about calibration. The two clear values to map were the sound frequencies from the buzzer and the values being outputted on the serial monitor from the capacitive sensor. I thought it would be interesting to map what happens to the sound frequencies as I change the proximity of the copper coils. I uploaded this code to output both values onto my serial monitor to test this:</p>

            <iframe src="https://app.arduino.cc/sketches/02d368e7-faa3-44dd-b06a-582cdad215e8?view-mode=embed" style="height:510px;width:100%;margin:10px 0" frameborder=0></iframe>

            <p>The results of this experimentation yielded the following graph:</p>

            <img src="output.jpg" alt="stuck display" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

            <p>The graph reflects the influence of the proximity of the coils in the circuit on the sensor's output. When the coils are closer together, the mutual inductance increases, resulting in stronger signals being generated in the circuit. This enhanced coupling often corresponds to higher frequencies, as seen in the larger sensor values at elevated frequencies. The nonlinearity in the graph happens because the circuit responds unevenly to changes in frequency or proximity, likely due to how the components interact, how sensitive the sensor is at different frequencies, and limits in how much signal it can handle.</p>

            <h3>Assignment 2: [Use + Calibrate Another Sensor]</h3>

            <h4>Input Sensor: Phototransistor</h4>

            <p>I really wanted to learn how to program a phototransistor today. A phototransistor’s output values depends on how much light hits its face. In general, resistance goes down as light levels increase and go up as light levels decrease. Arduinos measure voltage. This means that as light increases, voltage goes up and as light decreases, voltage goes down.</p>

            <p>Here is the schematic for my circuit:</p>

            <img src="PhotoresistorSchematic.jpg" alt="stuck display" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

            <p>The phototransistor gets 5V from the Arduino’s power supply and then connected to a resistor which connects to ground. We are measuring the voltage on that pin using the arduino analog input A0. This forms a voltage divider circuit.</p>

            <p>This was what my circuit looked like fully constructed:</p>

            <img src="IMG_0057.jpg" alt="stuck display" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

            <p>I then tried uploading some code and my circuit was not working. I tried switching out the resistors for different values and it still wasn’t working. Then I realized that the threshold I was setting (500) was way too high. I looked at the values on the serial monitor and realized that when I covered the phototransistor, the value was around 1 (see, it is true that voltage goes down when it gets darker) and hovered around 8-10 in ambient lighting.</p>

            <p>Here is the finalized code:</p>

            <iframe src="https://app.arduino.cc/sketches/5af06617-3a4b-4ff2-8ddb-a48a301f0e21?view-mode=embed" style="height:510px;width:100%;margin:10px 0" frameborder=0></iframe>

            <p>And a video demo of the sensor functioning with the output LED:</p>

            </video>

            <p>Then it was time to calibrate!</p>























            <p> Our team was responsible for the locomotion of the pipe robot, which involved designing its overall structure, integrating the servo and stepper motors for movement, and developing the drive system to ensure it could move forward and turn effectively. </p>

            <h4>Step 1: Stepper Motor Activation</h4>

            <p>Before developing our rough prototype, we began with the most basic aspect of the design: getting the stepper motor to move. To achieve this, we built the following circuit:</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9650.jpg" alt="esp32 pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 600px; height: 500px; margin-right: 10px;">
                </div>
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9645.jpg" alt="oled pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 600px; height: 500px;">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The correct code is displayed below: </p>

            <p>Here is a video of the stepper motor rotating after uploading the code:</p>

            <video controls>
                <source src="./IMG_9644.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>

            <h4>Step 2: Rough Prototyping with Legos</h4>

            <p>We then used legos to start doing some very rough prototyping with our rotating steppor motor. We used a heat gun to attach lego wheels onto our motor to analyze its motion.</p>

            <p>Then, using the legos, we started experimenting with different design options. We liked the idea of using a gear system with a front and back axle to rotate the wheels. We experimented with several different orientations of this gear system below:</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <div style="display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 300px;">
                    <video controls style="width: 100%; height: 100%;">
                        <source src="./IMG_9649.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                </div>
                <div style="display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 300px;">
                    <video controls style="width: 100%; height: 100%;">
                        <source src="./IMG_9647.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                </div>
                <div style="display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 300px;">
                    <video controls style="width: 100%; height: 100%;">
                        <source src="./IMG_9648.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                </div>
            </div>

            <br> 
            
            <p>We settled on what we believed was the most efficient system and captured an image of it:</p>

            <img src="IMG_9652.jpg" alt="stuck display" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

            <p>We began building a rough prototype as a proof of concept of our motion. In this iteration, we wanted to mostly pay attention to housing our different components in an economical way. When everything was taped together, our rough prototype looked like this:</p>

            </video>

            <p>Here is a video of the rough prototype in action:</p>

            </video>

            <h4>Step 3: Servo Activation</h4>

            <p>With the remaining time we had, we also constructed a quick circuit to get the servo moving so that we could now incorporate the front wheels into our design.</p>

            <p>The code for the servo can be accessed below:</p>

            <p>Here is a video of the servo in action:</p>

                <source src="./IMG_9717.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>

            <h4>Next Steps</h4>

            <p>Going forward, we need to more effectively secure all of our pieces together in a more streamlined prototype and work on integrating our design with the snakehead team to accommodate the servo. We also need to begin 3D printing pieces to warehouse the different components and secure them together more reliably. With this, we should accomplish a more polished prototype. </p>

            <h4>Final Prototype Iteration I </h4>

            <p>When our team reconvened, we spent time sketching our final design. Pictured below are several sketches of our first idea.</p>

            <p>Based on these sketches, we began 3D printing several pieces. The first part we printed was an L bracket, which would be secured to the servo. This bracket was designed to hold the camera and connect to the front wheels. We positioned the camera at the front to capture potential obstacles, while the front wheels were linked to the servo to control turning. The motor-powered rear wheels would then follow the rotation of the front wheels. </p>

            <p>The .stl file for the L bracket is pictured below:</p>

            <p>The next parts we 3D printed were the gearbox, gears, and the front and back axles. Initially, we planned to position the motor behind the servo to save space. However, we discovered that the motor would interfere with the servo, limiting its rotation. As a result, we decided to house and secure the motor separately. We designed a gearbox to enclose the motor and turn the axle. Additionally, we created a connector on the gearbox to attach it to the servo compartment, making the setup resemble a train.</p>

            <p>The .stl file for the gear box, gears, and axles is pictured below:</p>

            <h4>Final Prototype Iteration I in Action</h4>

            <p>After printing all the components, we began assembling our first final prototype iteration. During the first assembly, however, we realized that the dimensions of our prints were too precise, leaving very little tolerance. As a result, we had to reprint the axles, making them smaller to fit properly within the holes. Once the sizing was corrected and all the pieces were secured, we conducted a proof-of-concept test to ensure the pipe robot moved and turned as expected. The test was successful!</p>

            <img src="IMG_9770.jpg" alt="stuck display" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

            <p>Here is a video of the forward movement!</p>

            </video>

            <h4>PROBLEM!</h4>

            <p>Sadly, our design wasn't perfect. We realized that it was too wide to fit within the pipe. To address this, we needed to completely redesign the gearbox to reduce its width. This involved raising the gearbox to allow the wheels to be placed directly underneath, rather than on the sides, which helped minimize the overall width. We then began 3D modeling a new gearbox for the second iteration of our final prototype.</p>

            <h4>Final Prototype Iteration II</h4>

            <p>In progress...</p>
