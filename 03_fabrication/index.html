<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>

<h4>Kinetic Sculpture</h4>

<p> This week’s kinetic sculpture required a lot of time and multiple iterations to get it to a semi-functional point. Next week, I aim to create a finalized iteration. </p>

<h5> My Idea </h5>

<p> I was inspired by this video to create an Avatar-esque earth-bending kinetic sculpture in which there was a rotating system that simulated the effect of pushing earth up from the ground in a sequential pattern. </p>

<img src="fusionstage.jpg" alt="Fusion Sketch" style="width: 600px; height: auto;">
<p> To begin, I started by designing my box/stage in Fusion with my earth bending symbol design engraved into the box. I needed to laser cut multiple versions of this box to adjust the hole sizes on its two sides. </p>

<img src="inspiration.jpg" alt="inspiration" style="width: 600px; height: auto;">

<p> This CAMS system inspired the rotational aspect of my design. A wooden rod would be placed through my stage to form the core of this system and attached to the rod would be various laser cut circles offset from each other. The idea is that the circles would be stable on the rod in set positions and when the rod rotates through a motor, the circles move up and down, with their heights offset one another, moving the smaller rods on top of them up and down in different directions. </p>

<h6> Fabrication Process </h6>

<p>The early issue I was running into was the hole size for my design. I measured the rod’s diameter to be 7.8 mm with calipers and knew that I would have to account for kerf so I laser cut circles to test different diameters including 7.2 mm, 7.4 mm, and 7.6 mm. With all of these measurements, the rod either did not fit through the hole or there was too much friction and so I made the hole size bigger to equal 8 mm. This measurement provided enough space for the rod to freely rotate and so after this testing, I laser cut a final version of my stage with the appropriate hole size as well as 15 circles. </p>

<p> In terms of the assembly, I thought through how I would want to offset my circles so that when the rod rotated, they would move in a desired way for my design. What I thought about was when the preceding circle was at its highest point in the rotation, I wanted the following circle to be slightly lower in height and offset from that so that when one circle comes up and then starts coming down, the next one would go up to its highest point as the preceding circle is coming down, simulating the effect you see in the video. It proved a struggle to place the circles in the exact spot that I wanted. Due to my system not being glued together, it was hard to hold all of the necessary pieces in place enough to ensure completely accurate placement. Although I did markings with pencil to get a pretty accurate placement of the circles, in future iterations, I will have to continue optimizing their placement to produce the desired motion. </p>

<p>Once that part of the CAMS system was secure, I moved on to the next part which was developing stabilized miniature rods that would move up and down based on the circles’ rotation and essentially push up my rocks. I had already laser cut two blocks of wood spanning the length of my box as well as rectangular legs to go underneath the mini rods. The first problem I ran into was once again finding the correct hole size. I measured the diameter of the rod to be 4.7 mm and found a drill bit that was the same size. I drilled 4.7 mm holes into the wood. </p>

<img src="stabilizers.jpg" alt="stabilizers" style="width: 600px; height: auto;">

<p> A second note is that I was also finding it incredibly difficult to manually line up the holes I was drilling into my wood with the middle of the circles. After several failed attempts, I decided to use Fusion to my advantage for a more accurate placement of the holes. With calipers, I measured the appropriate distances between the circles and between the circles and sides of the stage. Based on these measurements, I laser cut the 4.7 mm holes into my rectangles instead of drilling them. 

Nevertheless, upon testing, this hole size was still providing a ton of friction, preventing the system from moving, and so I began using box cutters to begin opening the holes up. In future iterations, the hole size will be perfected.

The next problem I encountered was the assembly of this top part of the CAMS system. Due to the limited space of my box, I could not attach the stabilizing rectangular pieces and then slide in the rod with the foot attached to it. What I then did was create a box in which both of these rectangular pieces were attached to each other and then added two lips. My idea was that this box could be slid in and out for easier assembly. </p>

<img src="stablebox1.jpg" alt="box 1" style="width: 600px; height: auto;">

<p> This box was very DIY and made with a box cutter. I wanted to make the circles and design overall more streamlined to ensure more accuracy in my design. Thus, I remade the box design in fusion and laser cut it out, leading to a better product. </p>

<img src="box2.jpg" alt="box 2" style="width: 600px; height: auto;">

<p> Once my system was mostly assembled, I began testing out the motion. Unfortunately, while some of the rods were moving as expected, others were encountering heavy friction. I also noticed that the feet attached to the bottom of the miniature rods were rotating and interfering with each other. This led me to use a saw to cut them into smaller squares so that they didn’t interfere with each other as much. 

I did this and it still didn't work. I noticed that the feet were just not stable and their rotation was causing heavy friction. Thus, I decided that I needed to print 2 additional circles that were slightly larger than my current circles to form walls that restricted the motion of the feet. With the first print I did, the outer circles were too large and kept coming in contact with the box. This led me to minimize the size of my circles considerably so that this friction was prevented in my next print. </p>

<p> This video shows a proof of concept with my new circles that have the restricting border. It took me all week to get the mechanism right. However, now that I know that it can work with one rod, I can continue replicating this design and next week, move towards having a final earth-bending product. </p>

<p> Here is the same proof of concept video powered by a motor this time. To attach the motor, I had to laser cut circles with an adaptor cut inside them that could fit a motor. </p>
