            <h2>Week 8: CNC Milling</h2>

            <h3>Assignment: Make Something With CNC</h3>

            <p>This week, we focused on CNC milling and molding & casting techniques. Our assignment was to design and manufacture an object using CNC machinery (either the ShopBot, Shaper, or SRM-20), and produce another item through molding and casting. I wanted to use this week to create items that would be useful in my everyday life.</p>

            <p>I have been revamping my room decor lately and have really been wanting to include some Harry Potter decor. I decided to mill the Hogwarts castle into wood to display in my room. I also am planning on being Arwen for Halloween this weekend and so I wanted to create a mold of her iconic evenstar necklace.</p>

            <h3>Using the ShopBot</h3>

            <h4>Hogwarts Decor</h4>

            <p>First, I attempted CNC milling with the ShopBot. I wanted to spend more time this week learning how to operate the machinery so instead of creating a design on Fusion, I found the Hogwarts design online and converted it into an .svg file. I then imported this .svg file into Fusion, modified the dimensions, and then exported it to a .dxf file that you can access by clicking here!</p>

            <p>I loaded my .dxf file into Aspire, modified the dimensions of the design, and also added the thickness of the wood I was cutting into. I obtained this measurement using calipers. The next part of preparing my design for cutting was pain-staking! Bobby showed me how to navigate to the pocket toolpath icon so I could carve my design as pocket cuts. Pocket cuts remove material from a specified area, creating a flat cavity with a defined depth and boundaries. The issue I ran into with my design early on resulted from its intricacy. I initially wanted to carve the Hogwarts design into the wood. However, Bobby and I realized that the pocket cuts could not be made because the dimensions I was working with were far too small and the machine could not fit in those tiny spaces to make the cuts properly. Thus, I decided to make my pocket cuts in the inverse way: I would essentially mill out the background, so that the Hogwarts design protruded outwards. I thought this design may even have a cooler effect than what I originally intended. I then set upon the tedious process of making pocket cuts throughout my design. I set the pocket cut depth pretty close to the total depth of the material.</p>

            <p>Next, I set up the ShopBot for use. I secured my wood piece above the sacrificial layer using the plastic screw gun. I used the 1/8” drill bit to carve out the design. The program calculated a toolpath that would cut out the design. After zeroing my Z-axis, I then turned on the machine and began the cutting process!</p>

            </video>

            <p>This was the result:</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9452.jpg" alt="esp32 pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 500px; height: 500px; margin-right: 10px;">
                </div>
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9472.jpg" alt="oled pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>I was very pleased with the way this came out as I was unsure how it would look having had to invert the way I was engraving my design. The only thing I didn’t like was that the color of the wood was a bit uneven across the design. However, since I wanted this to be colorful room decor, I thought I could remedy the issue by just painting it! I didn’t get to fully finish painting this week but here is the progress I have made:</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9482.jpg" alt="esp32 pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 400px; height: 500px; margin-right: 10px;">
                </div>
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9485.jpg" alt="oled pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;">
                </div>
            </div>

            <h4>Arwen's Evenstar</h4>

            <p>I wanted to use the ShopBot to try and cut out my Evenstar necklace. I figured I could then vacuum form it to create my silicone mold. This is where I began running into problems! I once again found the Evenstar design online, converted it into an .svg file, and modified the dimensions on Fusion before exporting it to a .dxf file. You can access that here!</p>

            <p>The issue with my evenstar design was again it’s intricacy and size. The lines were incredibly thin and the regions of space between the pieces I wanted to cut out were very tiny. As I was trying to make pocket cuts on Aspire, my design was not rendering fully because the drill bit could not capture all of the cuts. I tried changing the drill bit to 1/16” and the design still wouldn’t render, leading me to have to use the 1/32” drill bit to achieve my complete design.</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9458.jpg" alt="esp32 pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 500px; height: 500px; margin-right: 10px;">
                </div>
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9457.jpg" alt="oled pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>I secured my new piece of wood and set up the machine in the same way and then began the process of cutting out my evenstar. So far so good, I thought...</p>

                <source src="./IMG_9467.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>

            <p>Wrong! :( ... My design ended up breaking as the CNC cut into it too much:</p>

            <img src="IMG_9470.jpg" alt="stuck display" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

            <p>I realized that the lack of space I was working with in my design made the ShopBot unideal to work with and so I moved onto trying the SRM-20.</p>

            <h3>Using the SRM-20</h3>

            <p>I wanted to use the SRM-20 to try to make a wax mold of the evenstar. I went back into Fusion and edited my design to place a box around it and also extrude the evenstar. You can access the .stl file I used by clicking here!</p>

            <img src="IMG_9471.jpg" alt="stuck display" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

            <h3>3D Printing to the Rescue!</h3>

            <p>I decided to just 3D print my .stl file to create the basis of my mold that I would pour silicone into. The 3D print took about 2 hours and came out like this:</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9509.jpg" alt="esp32 pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 500px; height: 500px; margin-right: 10px;">
                </div>
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9506.jpg" alt="oled pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;">
                </div>
            </div>


            <h3>Casting</h3>

            <p>With the 3D printed mold done, I moved on to casting my evenstar using silicone. I used Silicone Rubber Super Elastic Translucent 2-part silicone to cast a silicone mold from the 3D printed mold. I mixed parts A and B together in a 1:1 ratio following the instructions on the box. I used an equal volume, not weight, of parts A and B. I then sprayed mold release agent into my mold:</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9515.jpg" alt="esp32 pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 500px; height: 500px; margin-right: 10px;">
                </div>
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9520.jpg" alt="oled pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>After these preparation steps, I poured my silicone into the mold, making sure to fill it up enough so that there was adequate volume above my design. I let the mold solidify overnight:</p>

            <img src="IMG_9517.jpg" alt="stuck display" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

            <p>Next, I removed my silicone from the 3D printed mold and achieved a silicone mold of the Evenstar.</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9529.jpg" alt="esp32 pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 500px; height: 500px; margin-right: 10px;">
                </div>
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9530.jpg" alt="oled pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>I decided to cast dry stone into my silicone mode to arrive at my final design. Per the directions on the dry stone recommending 20 parts water to the dry stone, I mixed about 26 grams of dry stone with 6 grams of water. I also added some blue acrylic paint to color my mixture. I then poured it into my mold:</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9531.jpg" alt="esp32 pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 500px; height: 500px; margin-right: 10px;">
                </div>
                <div style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="IMG_9536.jpg" alt="oled pinout" class="img-fluid" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>After letting my mold sit overnight, this was the final product:</p>
